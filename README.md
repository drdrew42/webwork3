# webwork3

There are three main parts of this repository:

* webwork-common: basic functionality (database and other utils)
* webwork-api: mojolicious server backend to handle api requests.
* webwork-front-end: new webwork interface.

## webwork-db

This is code to handle a new database structure for webwork and
other utilities needed for non-gui webwork functionality.

Go to `t/README.md` for information about all of the testing code available. This will also show how to access the database layer.
